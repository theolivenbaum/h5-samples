H5 is a modern fork of the original [Bridge](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/bridge) C# to Javascript compiler, updated to support multi-platform development using .NET 6.0 and .NET Standard 2.1 projects, while dropping support for legacy features and dependencies.

This repository provides some samples on how to use [h5](https://h5.rocks).
